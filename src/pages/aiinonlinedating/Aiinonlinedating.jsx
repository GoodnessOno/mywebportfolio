            We all want to feel special and well taken care of, but many startup founders tend to miss this very important factor. 
            Customers are the lifeblood of any business. When scaling startups, your customer's journey from the second they desire the services your industry provides to the actual purchase holds more value for industry expansion and creation than you think. 
            <br />
            Let's take a walk down the dating aisle. 
            <br />
            <br />
            We live in an era where dating has become like a second job and we all want to get it right in our way, so imagine if your company expands the industry beyond just matching people on dating apps. 
            One of the key struggles we face is deciding where the first date will be, after all, we all want it to be special and memorable and being able to solve that dilemma might just be the key to scaling your startup and leaving the red ocean. 
            A company that goes beyond just matching me to my ideal date but also recommends the right (or probably perfect) restaurant or date location for the first date will be a household favourite and might be preferred to other companies in the same industry. This has even been made easy thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
            What are your thoughts on this, do you know any company currently implementing this strategy or would you be implementing this strategy? I would love to know how it turns out for you.
